# Rock, Paper, Scissors
[Live site](https://dom123x456.github.io/ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS/)

This game is a classic Rock, paper, scissors game. with a rudemntory rule of playing against the computer 1 game matches deciding in a win draw or lose. 

## UX - User Experience

### User experince intention
I want the user to:
- Play an entertaining game.
- Be able to make their own choices fighting the computer.
- See the rules at all times.
- See the results for each round.

### Colour
I chose a selection of colors starting from:
- cornflowerblue
- lightgrey
- blue 
- red 
- black
- white
The intent was to keep the UI brightly lit and visble with good contrast between the colours and I believe I have managed this in my design.

#### Structure
For the layout of the page, I chose to create a game window with two light grey borders around it. The window is also shaped with round corners, containing text and buttons within the first and text an a image. I chose to have the rules accessible at all times due to them being located on the same page of the "Rock, paper, scissors" game.

#### Typography
The font I chose was Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif as a simple easy to recognise font so that the user could easily read the text. This version of new roman was alot cleaner then some of all the defualt options I had acsses to so I stuck with it.

## Features
The game is simple with one game page with contain three buttons four images and text which is contained into two sections. One window for choosing your choice to be put against the computer and one for the game rules itself. 

### Game page section
The page contains the game itself and the options to play. This page also give the user instructions on how to play the game. The game is a lot of trial and error. 

### Rules
 By always showing the rules on the main game page I can avoid the user getting confused about why for those who havent played the game before. The information is right there and the user can understand the logic. 


## Testing

### Device testing
The game has been tested on multiple devices using the Mozilla dev tools. These are the devices:
- iPhone SE (2:nd generation)
- iPhone 11 (Pro + Pro Max)

### Game logic testing
I tested the game logic multiple times. The part where your choice and the computer's choice are compared was tested the most. Each possible combination was tested to make sure the result was correct. Every other part of the game was tested similarly.

### Fixed bugs
- I had an issue where my javascript was not applying to my buttons but then was fixed by adding text into the button to link the javascript to the index.

### Deployment
This game was deployed to github pages.

- Open the repository settings.
- Go to "pages" (found under "code and automation").
- Choose which branch to build from. You want to choose "main". Do not forget to save the settings.
- Open the repository in github desktop (I used github desktop. You can do this in git too.)
- Choose to create a local clone (the first time you open your repository in github desktop, there should be a window asking if you want to create a clone)
- Copy the link to your deployed website (which can be found in the github pages settings, where you chose which branch to build from) and make sure it is operating as expected.
- The deployed website will now be updated when you push anything new to the repository.

#### Forking and cloning
- Forking is creating a new repository with the same content as the one you forked. 
    - This is done by going to the repository you want to clone, and clicking the "fork" icon in the top right corner.
- Cloning is used for making local copies of your code.
    - Cloning a repository with github desktop is easily done by clicking the green "code" button and choosing the "open in github desktop" option. If you do not have a clone already, github desktop will ask if you want to create a local clone. Click yes.
    - If you do it with git you have to write "git clone" and then specify what you want to clone.
